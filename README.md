# Credit-Card-Defualt-Prediction
This project is based on machine learning classification algorithm.
1.Logistic Regression
2.Decision Tree
3.Random forest
Problem Statement
This project is aimed at predicting the case of customers default payments in Taiwan.
We can use the K-S chart to evaluate which customers will default on their credit card payments.

CONCLUSION
After performing the various model we get the best accuracy form the all the models except random forest.
Random Forest is the least accurate as compared to other models as it shows overfitting of the model.
XG boost and Logistic regression has the best precision and recall Balance.
Higher recall can be achieved if low precision is acceptable.
We can deploy the model and can be served as an aid to human decision.
Model can be improved with more data and computational resources.
It is important to have models deployed on the cloud with live customer interaction through app or mobile phone so that suspicious activities/a missed payment can be verified real-time with a text message or a push notification.
